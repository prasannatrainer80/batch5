Collections : 
______________


Arrays are static data structures, means once they are assigned we cannot alter the size, 
so if you want to add the elements irrespective of size, then we need the help of collections. 

Collections can grow to any size unlike arrays. 

Collections are basically from java.util package. 

Scanner class : This class allows you to read the data from keyboard/file etc...

How to read the data from keyboard is 

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

next() -> Used to read one word from keyboard. 

nextLine() -> Used to read entire sentence

nextInt() -> Used to read integer value

nextDouble() -> Used to read double value

nextBoolean() -> Used to read Boolean value. 

Properties : Provides an opportunity to protect a field in a class. If you want to control the internal behaviour of particular entity, then we need the help of properties. Properties are also known as methods, which are used to value type operations.

Collections by default stores data in Object format. 

There are various types of properties known as 

1) Read Only

2) Write Only

3) ReadWrite 


In Collections we have top 3 interfaces available known as 

(i) List interface : Contains list of values for particular entity.  In this interface we have ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector 

(ii) Set interface

(iii) SortedSet interface

Collections contains wrapper classes, ensures primitive data type classes as

values to be stored in object format 

Example : 

int x=12;

there x is a variable. 

Integer x = new Integer(12);

This is known as Wrapper class. 

as 12 will be stored as an object format. 


Vector allows you to define default size. and it increments as specified.

Vector vector = new Vector(3,2);

Initially it allocates memory for 3 elements, when 4th element comes, then it adds 2 more elements into that.
