switch...case : Used to define the menu-driven programs. 

switch(expression) {
   case expression1 : statement(s);
		      break;
   case expression2 : statemenet(s);
		      break;
    ...
    ...
    ...
}

What is yield : 

Yield keyword lets us exists a switch expression by returning a value that becomes the value of switch expression.
This means we can assign the value of a switch expression to a variable. 

Lastly, by using yield in switch... we can get implicit check that we are covering all cases. 

Looping Control Structures : 
____________________________

while loop : This loop executes all the statement(s) repeatedly until the condition remains true, if the condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop.  For every loop, basically there are 3 phases known as 

	(i) Initialization

	(ii) Condition

	(iii) Increment/Decrement 

Initialization performed at the beginning of the loop.

Condition performed at the conditional part of the loop.

Increment/Decrement performed before closing the loop.

while(condition) {
   statement(s);
}


for loop : This loop executes all the statement(s) repeatedly until the condition remains true,
if the condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop.  

for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement) {
   statement(s);
}


1) Write a Program to implement sample current bill as take no.of units as input and calculate bill as

first 90 units 1 rs per unit

91 to 150 units 1.5 rs per unit

151 to 200 units 2 rs per unit

201 to 250 units 2.5 rs per unit

251+ units 3rs per unit 

for example : 

If units are 180 then 

(90*1) + (60 * 1.5) + (30 * 2) 


2) Write a program to print prime numbers of given range

3) Write a Program to check the given number is perfect or not 

4) Write a Program to print pascal triangle
