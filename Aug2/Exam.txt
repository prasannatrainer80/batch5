1) Create a class as Student with attributes (sid int, sname String, city String, cgp double) 

    Add 10 records and Sort them 
	By Namewise Descending Order

	By cgp wise ascending order

2) Same Code add duplicate Student Records and Delete them

3) Convert List<Student> to Student[] and print them (Convert Generic List into Student Array) 

4) Create an abstract class called Training and in that add 2 abstract methods as 
		abstract void timing(); abstract void trainer();

	For that create 3 child classes as DotnetTraining, JavaTraining, SqlTraining 

	and add mix of class objects to Training[] as 

	Training[] arr = new Training[] {
		new DotnetTraining(), new JavaTraining(), new SqlTraining()....

	};

In that please print only JavaTraining object details 

5) Write a code to create map interface with HashTable and add 10 records as

	Map<String,Double> map = new HashTable<String,Double>();

Add 10 records and iterate them. 

Check will it take duplicate keys or duplicate values and write your observations in program comments
