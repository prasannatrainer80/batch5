WebApplication : These are the applications, that which are to be called from various places rather than where
they are created. 

If you want to make any distributed or enterprise apps then we need the help of web apps. 


You can create web applications in 2 ways as

(i) Scripting Languages

(ii) Programming Languages 

What is the difference between scripting languages and programming languages ???

Scripting languages are languages that which are interpred, during runtime they takes lot of time to execute. 

Programming languages are languages that which are compiled first, during runtime they takes very less time to execute. 

In Web applications, we can implement 


(i) Client-Side 

	Enables you to access the application from the client-system

	No Network traffic

	Execution will be faster 

(ii) Server-Side 

	Enables you to access the application from the server-system

	Network traffic is high

	A bit slower. 


*** Any intranet based application w.r.t. No Security, please opt for client-side scripting ***

*** Any internet based application w.r.t. min. security, please opt for both client-side/server-side scripting ***

*** Any internet based application w.r.t. High security, please opt for server side scripting only ***


HTML (HyperText Markup Language) Which used to create any sample web pages. 

How to start with HTML, 

You can start html, using <html> </html> 


<head> </head> : Contains global content for the given page.
